# Delieverable-Lab-1

This project is Part One of the “Deliverables” for the Grand Circus Java Bootcamp Pre-work (Unit 1). It is not meant for public consumption, though it should be able to stand up to scrutiny. 

This program is designed to break apart the digits of two integers, add the digits that occupy the same respective place in each integer, and then compare those sums to see if they are the same as each other. It seems complicated to explain every time.

You can enter integers of any size, so long as it's actually an integer, as Java understands it.

The actual .java file is in the SRC folder. 

I tried to be as thorough as possible, so I welcome you to throw whatever challenges you have at this code. I believe it’s water tight, but other people can always come up with things I hadn’t thought of.

The code should be able to handle any input without crashing and burning. 

Feel free to contact me or comment on any bugs or peculiarities.
